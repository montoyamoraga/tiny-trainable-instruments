\chapter{Context}

During this thesis I had this particular context:

\section{Language}

My native language is Spanish, and this thesis was written in English.

\section{Social}

This thesis was written during the COVID19 pandemic, during the longest stretch I have had of not visiting my home country Chile, or leaving USA and its east coast, and not working on a shared office, or living with roommates, or seeing family, limiting my physical interactions to mostly a handful of friends and to the internet.

\section{Location}

Written in Boston MA, New York City NY, Mt Airy MD, between November 2020 and July 2021.

\section{Software}

This thesis document was written using LaTeX and the Microsoft Visual Studio Code editor.

The TinyTrainable library was written in C++, and packaged as an Arduino library, relying on open source library dependencies by Arduino, Adafruit, and Google.

The auxiliary code is a mix of Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and shell scripts.

The documentation was written using Markdown.

The workshops were taught using the videoconferencing software Zoom, and organized via Google Forms.

\section{Hardware}

This project was written on a 2017 Macbook Air 13-inch, running macOS Catalina.

The software library and the software examples were written to be deployed on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microcontroller.
