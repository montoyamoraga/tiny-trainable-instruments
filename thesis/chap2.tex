\epigraph{All the modern things \\ have always existed \\ they've just been waiting}{The Modern Things \\ Björk, 1995}

This chapter describes the process of conceptualizing and developing this thesis project, which is an antidisciplinary project, drawing from folllowing disciplines:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Artificial intelligence
  \item Electrical engineering
  \item Computer science
  \item Media arts
  \item Music
  \item Pedagogy
\end{enumerate}

\section{Definitions}

In this section I include my personal definition of each concept of the title of this thesis project.

\subsection{Instruments}

By instruments I mean devices that act as transducers across mediums, processing an input, which results in an output.

 A musical example is the guitar, where the input strumming results in output sound. I mention the guitar because of its non linear and flexible behavior, with multiple different ways of strumming, even by non human agents, resulting in infinite sounds.

Another of my favorite instruments is the bicycle, which I like to define as a device that converts the input pedalling into all sorts of outputs: adventure, spin, sweat, wind in your face.

\subsection{Definition of trainable}

By trainable I mean a computational device that can learn by examples. This name comes from the machine learning lexicon, where training is a process where an algorithm finds the numerical values of all parameters (weights, biases) of a machine learning model, with the help of a dataset.

The process of training a model with a microcontro;ler has been really rewarding for me during the making of this thesis. When I program audiovisual computational devices to react to sensors, I often find myself having to look at streams of data, having to program statistical methods to detect trends, such as averages, and then having to program a hard coded value on the software, and having to write a manual for setup or fine tuning for collaborators to be able to run it again under different conditions.

The fact that I can program once, and then train on device, with the algorithm taking care of finding correlations, make for a more flexible workflow that I have enjoyed.

\subsection{Definition of tiny}

Bi tiny I mean handheld, light weight instruments that you can take for a walk or on your backpack. It is also an homage to the new uprising field of tiny machine learning.

The Tiny Trainable Instruments project is made up of these deliverables, which will be described in this order:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item TinyTrainable Arduino software library
  \item Auxiliary code for machine learning
  \item Workshop educational material
\end{enumerate}

\section{TinyTrainable Arduino software library}

The main contribution of this thesis is the TinyTrainable Arduino library, an open source library for creating Tiny Trainable instruments, as in microcontroller-based devices that you can train to react to gestures with machine learning, so they can process and output different multimedia events, such as sound, movement, light, and text.

\subsection{Repository structure}

The library is a repository hosted at \url{https://github.com/montoyamoraga/TinyTrainable}, where you can review all the history and commits through time, to see how the library or each file has evolved over time.

The structure of the folders follows 2 simultaneous specifications: it includes the necessary file and folder names for being packaged and indexed as an Arduino Library, and also it complies with GitHub guidelines for licensing and automatic workflows for testing the code.

The source code of the library is written in C++ and is located in the src/ folder. The examples live on the examples/ folder, and are written in Arduino. Some trained machine learning models are included as C++ files on the assets/ folder.

\subsection{Installation}

The library can be downloaded from the Releases section of the repository at  \url{https://github.com/montoyamoraga/TinyTrainable/releases}, where you also have access to the complete history of releases over time. To install it, you need to uncompress the .zip into a folder, and then make it discoverable by the Arduino IDE.

Since that method can be cumbersome and prone to errors, I made the effort to publish the TinyTrainable library, by complyiong with the latest Arduino Library Manager specifications, detailed on their repository \url{https://github.com/arduino/library-registry/}. With that, from the Arduino IDE you can open their Library Manager and do a one-click installation of the library, or even with the Arduino CLI you can install it via the command line on your machine.

\subsection{Hardware basics}

This library has only 1 fixed hardware requirement: it only runs on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, a microcontroller released in 2019. This library relies on the microcontroller's embedded sensors, so there is no need for wiring extra components.

For power you need a generic micro USB cable to provide the necessary input of 5V to the Arduino microcontroller. To upload code to the microcontroller you can use the same USB cable to connect to a computer running the Arduino IDE.

To build your instrument, you need a breadboard, jumper wires, and one of the many possible output devices that we describe in the following section.

\section{Technology stack}

This project is built with microcontrollers and 

\section{Design principles}

This thesis tries to 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Affordable
  \item Hackable
  \item Open
  \item Private
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Cheap}

The materials for this thesis 


\section{Open}

All examples included with this library were written with the aim of showing the fundamentals of how to build the instruments and different machine learning enabled manipulation of multimedia material, so that people could build on top of it and make it their own, by changing the values of variables and adding more functionalities.

\section{Philosophy and experience}

Throughout this project, the magic number was 3. The machine learning algorithms were hardcoded to be able to distinguish between 3 different categories: 3 colors, 3 physical gestures, 3 sound utterances.

\section{Inputs}

We are using the RGB color, proximity, gyroscope, accelerometer, and microphone sensors on the microcontroller, in order to capture the Inputs

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Color
  \item Gesture
  \item Speech
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Color}

This approach uses the RGB color sensor from the microcontroller, with the auxiliary help from the proximity sensor, that is used to capture color information at a certain distance threshold.

The data is passed to a k-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm, programmed using the Arduino KNN library.

\subsection{Gesture}

This input uses the information from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) of the microcontroller, including a gyroscope and accelerometer. It captures data after a certain threshold of movement is detected.

The data is passed to a TensorFlow neural network, programmed using the Arduino TensorFlow Lite library, and based on the included magic$\_$wand example.

\subsection{Speech}

This input uses the information from the microphone of the microcontroller.

The data is passed to a TensorFlow neural network, programmed using the Arduino TensorFlow Lite library, and based on the included micro$\_$speech example.

\section{Outputs}

The different outputs were picked, because of their low cost, ubiquity, and possibilities of expansion and combining them.

\subsection{Buzzer}

This output creates pitched sound, by using a PWM output.

\subsection{LED}

This section requires no dependencies.

\end{figure}

\subsection{MIDI}

We wrote functionalities to manipulate MIDI instruments, and included examples to interface with some popular and cheap MIDI instruments, such as the Korg volca beats.

We included examples for rhythmic and melodic elements, using two very ubiquitous and inexpensive MIDI musical instruments, which are the Korg volca beats, and the Korg volca keys.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Serial}

This output requires no library dependencies.

We use the already mentioned USB cable to connect to our computer, and receive messages over the serial port, available through the Arduino IDE.

\subsection{Screen}

This output requires a library for printing messages on a screen.

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \label{fig:materials-adafruit-screen}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Servo motor}

This output creates movement and through that, rhythmic sounds.

The main inspiration for this output was the emerging use of motor-activated percussive instruments, such as the Polyend Perc.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Thermal printer}

A thermal printer is the basis for creating written and literary output, inspired by the field of computational poetry.

I used the popular Adafruit Thermal printer kit, which is documented on their website and includes a software library, distributed over GitHub and Arduino IDE, and also as a submodule on this project's TinyTrainable software library.

\section{Development}

This thesis has been developed with the invaluable help of undergrad researchers Peter Tone and Maxwell Wang.

They have cloned both repositories, the main one and the Arduino library one, and have continuously submitted pull requests with their contributions.

Peter Tone has helped with research in data structures, library writing, and we have shared back and forth code, going from experimental proofs of concepts, and has also helped with the design of the user-facing library.

Maxwell Wang has proofread the code, has run the examples, and has helped with the writing of the documentation for self-learners and for the workshops.

We all share a Google Drive folder, where we all share notes about our research and development of the library and the educational material.

\section{Code}

This thesis is distributed as a repository, hosted on the GitHub platform, and available at https://github.com/montoyamoraga/tiny-trainable-instruments.

The auxiliary files, such as the LaTeX project for this document, and the auxiliary Jupyter notebooks, and documentation and tutorials are included on this repository.

The main software component of this project is the TinyTrainable library, available at https://github.com/montoyamoraga/TinyTrainable and also through the Arduino IDE.

The code included on this library is distributed on the folders:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item examples/
  \item src/
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{src/}

The source code for where there is a TinyTrainable.h and TinyTrainable.cpp file where we included all the basic functionality of the library. Additional subfolders include

\subsubsection{inputs/}

Base class Input and inherited classes for each one of the other inputs.

\subsubsection{outputs/}

Base class Output and inherited classes for each one of the other outputs.

\subsubsection{tensorflow/}

Auxiliary files, copied from the examples from the Arduino TensorFlow Lite that we are building on top of, and also from the newer TinyML library by the EdX team. These, unless otherwise noted, are included without modifications and distributed through the Apache License included on each file's headers.

\section{Opera of the Future projects}

During the development of this thesis, I have been fortunate to collaborate on different capacities with other thesis projects by classmates at Opera of the Future, which has directly inspired my work.

\subsection{Squishies, by Hannah Lienhard}

Squishies is Hannah Lienhard's master's thesis, and consists of novel squishable interfaces for musical expression. We shared discussions about low-level sound design, code reusability, sound art education, and digital instruments. We were part of a master's thesis working group, facilitated by Roya Moussapour with two other Media Lab classmates, where we workshopped drafts of our thesis. This practice and feedback has been critical in shaping the language and discourse of this thesis document.

\subsection{Fluid Music, by Charles Holbrow}

Fluid Music is Charles Holbrow's PhD thesis. It is a library for library design, documentation for contributors. The design of the interface, documentation, and scope of the thesis were a direct influence on the documentation and API coding style of this project.

Overall thoughts: I think it would be great if your Chapter 3 clearly led you to the design principles you lay out in Chapter 4. So, why is “open” important -> because of the collaborations or arduino libraries you used. Why is “cheap”/”privacy” -> coded bias and ability to tinker, etc.
