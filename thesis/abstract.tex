How can we build flexible multimedia instruments that we can train instead of program? How can we build and publish our own databases for artistic purposes? Tiny trainable instruments is a collection of instruments for media arts, using machine learning techniques and deployed in microcontrollers.

This thesis offers a proposal for the use of tiny machine learning for multimedia artistic purposes, with an emphasis on open source and machine learning ethics.
