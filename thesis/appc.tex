\chapter{Rules of thumb}

\epigraph{By pressing down a special key \\ it plays a little melody}{Pocket calculator \\ Kraftwerk, 1981}

During this thesis I have tried to follow these rules of thumb:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Work in public
  \item Share small steps
  \item Fail often
  \item Learn by trying
  \item Try to be active every day
  \item Prioritize open source
  \item Research who made the tools you are using
  \item Learn from other people and cite them
  \item Sleep as much as possible
\end{itemize}
