\chapter{Rules of thumb}

\epigraph{Wishes on a wheel \\ How it's supposed to feel}{Wishes \\ Beach House, 2012}

During this thesis I have tried to follow these rules of thumb:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Openly share small steps
  \item Learn by failing often
  \item Do a little bit every day
  \item Prioritize open source
  \item Research who made the tools you are using
  \item Learn from other people and cite them
  \item Sleep as much as possible
\end{itemize}
