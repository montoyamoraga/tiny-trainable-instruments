\chapter{Rules of thumb}

\epigraph{Wishes on a wheel \\ How it's supposed to feel}{Wishes \\ Beach House, 2012}

During this thesis I have tried to follow these rules of thumb:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Openly share small steps
  \item Learn by failing often
  \item Contribute back
  \item Use tools you like
  \item Cite other people
  \item Sleep as much as possible
\end{itemize}
