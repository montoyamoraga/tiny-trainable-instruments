# Tiny trainable instruments - Assent to participate in research

1. My name is Aarón Montoya-Moraga, and I am a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab, and research assistant at the Opera of the Future and Future Sketches research groups.

2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because we are trying to learn more about ways we can make machine learning and microcontrollers an easier and ethical way of building multimedia arts instruments, for artists and enthusiasts, through a new kind of software library we’ve created, and the machine learning algorithms we are using.

3. If you agree to be in this study, you will be sent a novel kit to build a multimedia instrument in the mail with instructions on how to set it up with your computer. You will then join an online workshop where you and a group of other adults age will get to build, program, and make art together, with the materials kit we sent you. After the workshop, we’ll send you a quick survey about your experiences building the instruments, and what you learned from them and the workshop.

4. We are working with electronics which can be a risk if misused. You should follow the instructions carefully, not break the parts, not use them with wet hands, and not use them around liquids.

5. Completing this study will give you the chance to learn some basic programming, machine learning, and multimedia art skills, and explore a new approach to build multimedia instruments.

6. If you don’t want to be in this study, you don’t have to participate. Remember, being in this study is up to you and no one will be upset if you don’t want to participate or even if you change your mind later and want to stop.

7. You can ask any questions that you have about the study now. If you have a question later that you didn’t think of now, you can email me at velouria@media.mit.edu, or ask me before, after, or during the workshops. You can also call the Chairman of the Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects at M.I.T. at 1-617-253 6787 if you feel you have been treated unfairly.

8. All data collected will be anonymized and not shared with anyone outside of the team behind this research.

9. Signing your name at the bottom means that you agree to be in this study. You will be given a copy of this form after you have signed it.
