# Tiny Trainable Instruments - Expedited Review Reasoning and COVID-19 Safety

I believe this project qualifies for expedited review because it poses less than minimal risk to the subjects. All data collected will be benign in nature, and will be fully anonymized from the start. We will collect information on a userâ€™s age, but not their date of birth. All participants will be adults over 18 years old.

The electronic components being used are off-the-shelf, commercially available components, which have not been modified in any way, and are being used as recommended by the manufacturer. All electronics will be connected via insulated Dupont jumper cables, with low voltages and with no soldering, using an electronics prototyping breadboard. More information is available in the technical overview document.

All workshops will take place virtually, so there will be no risks associated with COVID-19. The materials to build the Tiny Trainable Instruments will be sent with their original packaging from the manufacturer, and will either mailed via USPS, or have contactless pickup for people joining from Boston MA area, and from Santiago, Chile. The materials and the instruments built by the participants will be kept by them, so there will be no further mailing or contact.
