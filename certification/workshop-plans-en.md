# Tiny trainable instruments - Workshop plans

## Acquiring the materials

I bought the materials for the study and shipped them to both my residence in Boston MA USA, and to my mother's residence in Santiago Chile, directly from the stores Arduino and Adafruit via post service Fedex and UPS.

The participants of the study in USA are sent via USPS the complete kit with all the materials, and optionally they can do outdoors contactless pickup from my residence in Boston MA USA.

The participants of the study in Chile will do contactless pickup from my mother's residence in Santiago, Chile.

## Workshop preparation

Before the workshop you will install all the free necessary software on your computer, and you will be able to contact me over email or teleconference to help troubleshoot the installation. All software installed has instructions for easy uninstalling if you so desire after the workshop.

## During the workshop

The workshop is remote, and conducted via the teleconferencing app Zoom. It consists of 2 sessions of 2 hours each, on consecutive days, dedicated to building, programming, and playing with these new instruments. During these workshops, you will have the chance to make multimedia art with others, and ask questions about the instruments.

## After the workshop

After the workshop, you will be sent a short survey asking questions about your experiences using the instruments, and the workshop itself. You will then be able to keep all the materials and your instrument, so you can explore it more on your own.
