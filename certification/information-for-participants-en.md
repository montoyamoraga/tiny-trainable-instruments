# Tiny Trainable Instruments - Information for participants

The instruments we build are made out of off-the-shelf components, with an Arduino microcontroller chip being placed on a solderless breadboard, and connected with jumper wires to different low-voltage components for multimedia output, in particular a piezo buzzer for sound, and a micro servo motor for movement.

These are popular materiales used for teaching and construction of artistic and computational devices for interactive installations, music making, and beginner projects in general.

There is no unconventional wiring, everything will be powered with a micro USB cable from your computer, at safe voltages, with surge protection, and using isolated jumper cables on a mechanical stable electronics breadboard.
