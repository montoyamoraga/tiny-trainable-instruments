# Input-color

## About

input-color is an instrument that uses its sensors for measuring gestures, color, light intensity and proximity, to train a k-NN (k-nearest neighbors) algorithm. This allows you to control different multimedia outputs.

The instrument can be programmed with a computer and then run as a standalone instrument, or you can use its serial port to communicate with your computer for debugging or interfacing with other software.

All the training happens on the instrument, and it can be easily retrained by restarting it (press the button once).
