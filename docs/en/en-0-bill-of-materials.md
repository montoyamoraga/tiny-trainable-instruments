## Notes about the microcontroller

This project is based on the microcontroller `Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense`. Please don't confuse it with the similarly named `Arduino Nano 33 BLE` :)

The microcontroller is sold with and without headers and we recommend acquiring the one ***with headers***, so you can immediately start using it on a breadboard without needing to solder the headers on it.

## Minimum materials

This is the list of minimum required materials for Tiny Trainable Instruments
