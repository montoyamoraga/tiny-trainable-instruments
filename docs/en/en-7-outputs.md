# Outputs

In terms of output, here are some of the configurations we will use, sorted from simpler and cheap to complex and expensive.

### USB output

We can output data over the USB cable, using the serial port.

This output can range from debugging information, to data for controlling software. In this repository we include some open source audiovisual scripts and examples that you can expand on.

### LED output

The Arduino has LEDs that we use for showing the internal status of the microcontroller. For LED output we will wire additional LEDs to the Arduino.

### MIDI output

We can use the MIDI protocol, and a MIDI DIN connector to output information over the MIDI protocol.
